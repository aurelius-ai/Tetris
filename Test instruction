Open "BuildDabase.php" first to create the database and table. Just change the password in line 15 in the file "BuildDatabase.php" and it will create everything at once. 
Sorry for not using batch file. I just saw the changed instruction right before the deadline when I was about to upload my work. To change php file to batch file I need to change everything including project report because all my files are connected. ("BuildDabase.php" is connected to "TetrisLogin.php" and then "Tetris.php")
Even if the database file does not work, you can open “Tetris.php” directly, it will still work. Thanks!
